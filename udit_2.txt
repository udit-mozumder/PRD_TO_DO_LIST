Title: Customer Account Batch Update - Modern COBOL Implementation

Overview:

This document presents a modernized, refactored COBOL implementation for the batch update of customer account balances (ACCTUPDT-REFACTORED). The program processes daily transactions, updates account master records, and produces a financial audit report. Refactoring focuses on modular structure, elimination of GO TO statements, improved readability, dynamic date handling, and clear separation of business logic and reporting. All business rules and file interfaces are preserved, ensuring production safety and maintainability.

Section Explanations:

- File Handling: All file operations are clearly separated using SELECT and FD statements. File names are parameterized for easy migration.
- Data Structures: Account and transaction records use meaningful field names and explicit PIC clauses for clarity.
- Initialization: The program dynamically sets the run date from the system, improving flexibility and auditability.
- Main Logic: The main loop is modular, using PERFORMs for each logical step (initialization, processing, finalization).
- Transaction Application: The EVALUATE statement replaces legacy GO TO logic, ensuring maintainable and readable business rule application.
- Reporting: Audit report lines are constructed using STRING for clarity and maintainability, with explicit status flags for special cases.
- Error Handling: Unknown transaction codes and accounts with no transactions are flagged and reported, improving audit traceability.
- Modularity: Large paragraphs are split into focused sub-paragraphs, enabling easier maintenance and future enhancements.

Change Log:

- Eliminated all GO TO statements; replaced with structured PERFORMs and EVALUATE for control flow.
- Split monolithic paragraphs into modular, maintainable sections (e.g., INIT-SECTION, PROCESS-ACCOUNTS, APPLY-TRANSACTION).
- Hardcoded business date replaced with dynamic system date acquisition.
- File names and organization are clearly defined and easily parameterized.
- Packed decimal (COMP-3) usage retained for compatibility, but field names clarified for modern readability.
- Reporting logic separated from business logic; audit report lines use STRING for flexible formatting.
- Explicit status flags and error handling for unknown transaction codes and accounts with no transactions.
- Inline comments added for all major sections and logic blocks.
- All business rules preserved exactly as per original requirements.
- Code validated for production safety, maintainability, and downstream integration.
