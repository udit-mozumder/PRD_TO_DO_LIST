Title: Customer Account Update and Audit - Modern COBOL Implementation

Overview:

This program updates customer account balances based on daily transaction records and produces a financial audit report. The legacy COBOL code has been refactored to use modern COBOL standards for improved readability, maintainability, and performance. Key improvements include modular structure, meaningful variable names, structured control flow (elimination of GO TO), dynamic run date handling, and separation of business logic from reporting. All business rules and file interfaces are preserved for compatibility and correctness.

Section Explanations:

- **File Handling**: All input and output files are clearly defined in the FILE-CONTROL and FD sections. File names are currently hardcoded for compatibility, but can be parameterized in future enhancements.

- **Data Structures**: Master and transaction records use meaningful field names. Monetary values use COMP-3 for compatibility with legacy systems. Working-storage variables are named for clarity (e.g., WS-TOTAL-ACCTS).

- **Initialization**: The program dynamically sets the run date using ACCEPT, and opens all required files. No hardcoded business date is used.

- **Main Processing Loop**: Each master record is processed in turn. All matching transactions are applied using a structured PERFORM loop. Control flow is modular, eliminating GO TOs.

- **Transaction Application**: The EVALUATE statement is used for transaction code logic, improving readability and maintainability. Each transaction type (deposit, withdrawal, fee, unknown) is handled explicitly.

- **Reporting**: Report logic is separated from business logic. Each account update or no-transaction event is formatted and written to the report file. Summary counts are maintained and reported at the end.

- **Error Handling**: End-of-file conditions are managed with flags (WS-EOF-MASTER, WS-EOF-TRAN). Unknown transaction codes are reported but do not affect balances.

- **Modularity**: All major logic areas are split into paragraphs with clear names and responsibilities. No monolithic paragraphs remain.

Change Log:

- Refactored all GO TO-based logic into structured PERFORMs and modular paragraphs.
- Split monolithic paragraphs to separate file I/O, business rules, and reporting.
- Introduced meaningful variable and paragraph names for clarity.
- Replaced hardcoded business date with dynamic run date using ACCEPT.
- Retained COMP-3 usage for monetary values for compatibility; recommend migration in future.
- Separated reporting logic from transaction application logic for maintainability.
- Managed end-of-file and error conditions with explicit flags and checks.
- Preserved all business rules and file interfaces for behavioral compatibility.
- Added detailed inline comments for all major logic areas.
- Validated code for correctness, maintainability, and industry best practices.
