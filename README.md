Unit Testing
●	Test individual components like task creation, task updates, and user authentication.
Integration Testing
●	Test interactions between the database, UI, and API endpoints.

Load test
●	Response time, Rate limit, throughput, resource utilization (CPU, memory, etc.).

User Acceptance Testing (UAT)
●	Conduct beta testing with real users to gather feedback.

Post production validation ( PPV)
●	Conduct a ppv testing to functionality end to end post deployment in the production environment.

Future Enhancements

1. Team task automation - based on status changes
2. UI dark mode
3. Option to choose templates
4. Subscription module ( Basic pack, premium pack) on basic of feature and number of users.
5. Audit trail - Admin can view report for user activity ,users login and logout.
